When CSF leaks from the subarachnoid space due to a dural breach, it can result in decreased intracranial pressure, leading to a headache. This pain typically manifests within one or two days after spinal anesthesia, is generally self-limiting, and resolves within a week. In most cases, adequate oral hydration will suffice, though intravenous fluids may be necessary for those unable to drink sufficiently. Increased fluid intake helps restore intracranial pressure and alleviates headache symptoms.</span></p>

Propofol and rocuronium were administered for anesthesia induction. She is positioned in lithotomy with her head lower than her feet. A trocar was placed below the navel to create pneumoperitoneum. Shortly after the gas was introduced, her blood pressure dropped from 120/70 mmHg to 80/45 mmHg, and her heart rate fell from 70 beats per minute to 34 beats per minute.

<p><span style=""color: #000000; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"">Insufflation involves the use of carbon dioxide to create a pneumoperitoneum, which aids laparoscopic surgery by expanding the abdominal cavity for better visualization. However, this process can lead to complications like bradycardia, primarily due to increased abdominal pressure and the stretching of the peritoneum. The vagal-mediated cardiovascular reflex triggered by rapid distension is a key factor in bradycardia and hypotension. If these symptoms arise, cease insufflation and release some pressure.</span></p>

She received 10 mg of intravenous morphine for post-surgery pain relief. Shortly after the operation, the nurse observed that she became unresponsive and exhibited agonal breathing. She appeared cyanotic and produced gurgling sounds, which were alleviated by the nurse performing a jaw-thrust maneuver. Oxygen was administered through a face mask. Her respiratory rate was 8 breaths per minute, with diminished chest movements. Air entry was symmetrical, and no abnormal sounds were detected upon auscultation. Her blood pressure measured 110/70 mmHg, with a heart rate of 60 beats per minute. Her oxygen saturation was 96% while receiving 15 liters of oxygen. An arterial blood gas analysis revealed the following:</span></p><br /><p><span style=""color:#000000;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;"">Haemoglobin 111 g/L (115-160)</span></p><p><span style=""color:#000000;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;"">pH 7.25 (7.35 – 7.45)</span></p><p><span style=""color:#000000;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;"">PaO2: 8.5 kPa (10-14)</span></p><p><span style=""color:#000000;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;"">PaCO2: 7.8 kPa (4.7-6.0)</span></p><p><span style=""color:#000000;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;"">Bicarbonate 23 mmol/L (22-26)</span></p><br /><p><span style=""color:#000000;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;"">What is the next best course of action?</span></p></body></html>
